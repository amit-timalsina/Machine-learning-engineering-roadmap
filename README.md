# End to End machine learning

![Machine learning project lifecycle](link_to_image)

Machine learning is not just about building a model using some publicly available clean data. There are multiple steps that are required to build an ML product. The above is the end to end steps required to build a machine learning product that could potentially make an impact. I have a dedicated article series that goes into details of each step shown in above diagram. The below resources will help you on each step shown in above figure.

I will divide the resources into different levels of learning and will also provide the best resources to learn each topic. The levels of learning are:

- Getting ready to learn data science
- Core Data Science Fundamentals
- Machine Learning Engineering

## Getting ready to learn data science

### Applied Mathematics

Applied Mathematics is a combination of Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, and Calculus. There is a lot of buzz that you need to be really great at mathematics for getting into Data Science. Unless you want to be Machine Learning Researcher than fundamentals of the above topics is sufficient. Even better would be having good some grasp of high school Mathematics. You can always go to grad school to be a Machine Learning researcher or start learning complicated mathematics after you land a job.

Nonetheless, below i mention some great resources on coursera by Imperial college of London for Linear Algebra and Calculus. Their videos are publicly available on YouTube. For statistics & Probability, I have some great recommendations of courses by MIT OpenCourseWare

- Linear Algebra: Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra (Coursera), (YouTube)
- Statistics: MIT 18.650 Statistics for Applications (YouTube)
- Probability: MIT 6.041SC Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability (YouTube)
- Calculus: Mathematics for Machine Learning: Multivariate Calculus (Coursera), (YouTube)

### Programming Language

Deciding a Language:

Programming languages are essential tools for machine learning (ML) engineers, data scientists, and researchers to develop and deploy ML models. Machine learning requires programming languages that are capable of handling large datasets, performing complex computations, and integrating with powerful libraries and frameworks. The choice of programming language is critical for machine learning projects because it can affect development time, model performance, and scalability.

When it comes to choosing a programming language for machine learning, there are several criteria to consider:

- Learning curve: Ease with which a language can be learned.
- Community: A language with a large and active community means that there are more resources, tools, and support available online.
- Libraries and Frameworks: Existing libraries for every step of the machine learning pipeline as show in cover image of this article.
- Industry demand: You should consider the industry demand for different languages.
- Performance: Performance is a critical factor to consider when working with large datasets.

Python and R are most popular languages for machine learning. Other programming languages are Julia, Java, and C++. Let's see their comparison based on the criteria we discussed above:

Comparison of languages based on different criteria:

If you want to be a software engineer with skills in machine learning, go with Python - you don't even need to think twice. On the other hand, if you want to be a data scientist, you could choose either Python or R. But remember python will give you flexibility in your career if you ever want to pivot. On a personal note, I recommend python.

Congrats, you completed the first step on your journey.

Python for Beginners:

RealPython creates great resources for python developers of all levels. Their basic courses are a combination of video and text resources which have been praised by many.
